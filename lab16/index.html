                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to figure out and learn how JSON and APIs work together.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>There was a big problem during this lab and that was the API that professor Modes wanted us to use
                    was not working. The cors policy was changed which mean we do not have access to the API. I decided
                    to do a different API that gave random facts.</p>
                <p>Here is an image of the API not working:</p>

            <div id="reflection" class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This was a fun assignment but I am a little annoyed that what we were supposed to do does not work since it made it a lot harder for me.</p>

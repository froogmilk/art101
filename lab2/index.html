                <div class="section">
                    <p>The challenge of this lab is to learn HTML and CSS as well as experimenting
                        with the tools we are
                    <p>

                <div class="section">
                    <p>The main problems we faced though this lab was the positioning of text and images
                        on the web page. We were able to overcome this problem by experimenting and using
                        Wesbot as a tool to help us.

                    <p>We both think that this lab went verywell. We were able to create good looking
                        websites using the skills taught to us and using the internt as a tool to help
                        us through challenging parts.

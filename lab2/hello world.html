			<h1>Problems</h1>
                <div class="section">
                    <p>The main problems we faced though this lab was the positioning of text and images 
                        on the web page. We were able to overcome this problem by experimenting and using 
                        Wesbot as a tool to help us.

                        us through challenging parts.

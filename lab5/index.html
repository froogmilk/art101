				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge for this lab was learning the basics of javascript!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>When trying to write on JS my code did not "go blue" is the best way to put,
					while my partners make, model, color, year text turned blue mine did not.
					This stopped my JS code to be able to run. With the help of WesBot and ChatGBT
					I was able to fix it, except I don't actually know how it was fixed. I was trying
					all sorts of code to fix it such as "var", and "let" however nothing changed. After
					I asked ChatGBT and put in the code with "var" in front again and it ended up working.
					I still am unsure how putting in "var" for the second time ended up working but at
					least it got figured out!
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I thought that this lab was pretty fun, except for my little problem. My partner was
					super helpful in finding out what went wrong! I think that we did really good with this
					project, we both have a little bit of knowledge about JS however my partner knows a bit
					more then me so having her was super helpful. </p>

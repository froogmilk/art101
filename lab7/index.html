                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge for this lab was to create a function that would put the letters 
                    in a name in alphabetical order.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>I personally did not have any problems, however my partner Jacky had one. In her website 
                    the window prompt would come up multiple times rather than once. She used the help of 
                    WesBot to fix the code, sadly I did not know what was wrong and could not help her :(.) </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>I thought that this lab was pretty simple, we went over a lot of it in class and both my 
                    partner and I had a good understanding of what we needed to do! </p>

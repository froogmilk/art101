					<h2> About Me</h2>
					<p>Hiii I am Maya, I am a first year student at UCSC! I am double major in Art and History of Art
						and
						Visual Culture. I grew up in Sonoma County, specifically Sebastopol! I live in the middle of
						the forest and love to take walks through the woods. I graduated from Orchard View School
						after going there since I was in 6th grade! I took a gap year after highschool to travel and
						work! I spent a lot of time in San Diego and also went on a trip to Hawaii. I used to take a lot
						of trips to Santa Cruz and was so excited to get an acceptance letter, it was my top school
						and I am so happy to be here!</p>

					<p>As I mentioned I am an Art major as well as a HAVC major! I spent a lot of time doing art when
						I was younger so when I went to college I knew that is the major I wanted. I also spent a lot
						of time at museums! Of course, I've been to a lot of museums in San Francisco but I have also
						been to a bunch outside of the area. On all trips I have been on I always spend a significant
						amount of time at the museums! Speaking of traveling I absolutely love to travel, I actually
						have two trips planned this summer! Before I go into that, I have taken a trip to France, Washington
						DC and the surrounding area as well as a cruise from Alaska to Canada and some other states! This
						summer I am going to go to Italy with my family and I am also going to Portugal and Spain with my best
						friend! Other then traveling I also love reading and films. My favorite genre is fantasy! My favorite
						book and movie is Lord of the Rings! I spend a lot of time listening to music as well, I love a
						lot of genres but some of my favorite artists right now is Phoebe Bridgers, David Bowie and
						Fleetwood mac. My favorite color is probably green but I also love a ton of others! Cats are some of 
						my favorite animals, I have two Poe and Toe! I am hoping to get another names Tae so it can be 
						Poe-Tae-Toe! My cats are adorable and I love them so much. I also have a golden retriever named Maziy 
						she is so cute and friendly! Being in college I miss them so much but my mom always sends me photos! 
						So far programming has been super fun and I am excited to learn more! Anyways see yuh! </p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge for this lab is to create an array of numbers and add functions and callbacks.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>When putting the code into JS we experienced a loop, similar to before. We realized we had to get rid
                    of a few lines of HTML. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>We put a lot of effort into this project and did task X successfully. We also put a lot of effort into making sure the code
                    worked as well as have a good overall design. We can both better understand JS and how it connects to the CSS, HTML 
                    and the website.</p>

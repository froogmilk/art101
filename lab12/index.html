                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>For this lab we were challenged with creating a sorting hat, like the one from Harry Potter, that
                        depends on conditionals.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>The main problem during this lab is that I was not sorted into Slytherin like I should be. Aside
                        from that... we also had some issues having the input properly display the output however we
                        used trusty Wesbot to help us! </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This lab was pretty straightforward and fun, my inner Harry Potter nerd is geeking out. HOWEVER I
                        would love to be able to program it so that I am in the correct house or else I will riot, thank
                        you very much!</p>

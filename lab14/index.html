                <p>1. For lab 4, I realized that the JS files I had were called anagrams.js and woods.js while what my HTML was trying to connect to was called lab.js. Although my code still worked it was not correct so I changed it and now it looks good! </p>
                <p>2. For lab 8, I had two jQuery so I was able to remove one and get it working!</p>
